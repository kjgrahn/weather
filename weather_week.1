.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.
.B weather_week
reads
.BR weather (5)
data and renders the current week's temperature graph.
The graph is rendered in
.I \s-1SVG\s0
format. It's intended to be immediately readable, but not necessarily
detailed or very accurate.
What's plotted is:
.
.BP temperature
Air temperature; not the road temperature, which may also be available.
.
.BP wind
The mean wind force over ten minutes, and
(less distinctly) the max wind force over the past half hour,
if these are available in the input.
.
.PP
For other data that's not plotted, see
.BR weather (5).
.
.PP
The input files may contain data from several locations, in which case you
get several overlayed graphs.
This is useful if you're really interested in another, nearby location:
you're reminded of the inevitable errors involved.
.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.
.BP \-p\ \fIN
Render a previous week instead of the current one:
.B \-p1
for the past week,
.B \-p2
for two weeks ago, and so on.
.
.BP \-o\ \fIimage-file
The name of the image file to write.  If none is provided,
the image is written to standard output.
.
.BP --help
Print a brief help text and exit.
.
.BP --version
